          <h2>I began this study with the idea of finding out how well people felt the game conveyed the controls, and how to improve te way it does. This was an idea I kept in my head throughout the study 
            and many sections of the study were implemented to further m knowledge about this. However, I did find out some very interesting things about how Nebula Knights could be improved in other ways. 
            The first and major way I have found that Nebula Knights could be improved would be through the addition of a Walkthrough Tutorial. This would be a level much like the 2 levels currently in the 
            game except much shorter, that slowly introduces new mechanics in each new room until the player has been introduced to all of the mechanics needed. This would fit in well with the architecture 
            of the levels anyway as they are already seperated by room. This means a tutorial set of rooms before a level would seamlessly fit in with the levels as they are.</h2>

            <h2>Another improvement relating to the usability of the game that I found is the addition of a functional Options menu with graphical quality and audio settings. Many players reported that this
            would be a nice addition. It should, however, be noted that only a few of the participants found the lack of a menu annoying, many felt that it would be nice but not necessary. It would not take
            that much time or effort to add such a menu, as many things such as volume and resolution are dealt with in engine and there are simple commands to change this gamewide. The most time consuming
            part of this would be the process of designing the menu so it fit in with the style of the game and was easy and intuative to navigate. This would then require further testing which could take a
            much larger amount of time in an iterative manner.</h2>

          <h1> Conclusion</h1>
            <h2>
                In conclusion I think these two design changes could be effectively implemented if more time was to be spent developing this game further with relatively little effort. I feel the general response 
                in terms of usability was good and it showed that the game was effective at doing what it was meant to do; create a competitive but light hearted environment between players. I personally feel like
                a walkthrough tutorial would work well as a means to convey the controls, but would also add a good amount of content to the game. The game falls short in some other aspects such as the story and the
                info UI which many questionnaire answers scored how well the game conveys info mid game lowly, with an average of 5.85. However, the main issues mentioned above could be addressed in a relatively short
                period of time meaning that I believe that they should be prioritised. 

                This survey has proven invaluable in ironing out many creases in the game that would have otherwise slipped under the radar. It has allowed me an outside look at the game and how well people who weren't 
                involved in the development process could use the game. It showed me the atmosphere it can create between a group of players and, most importantly, it allowed me to assess weak areas and gain more information 
                on how to improve them.
