          <h2>I began this study with the idea of finding out how well people felt the game conveyed the controls, and how to improve te way it does. This was an idea I kept in my head throughout the study 
            and many sections of the study were implemented to further m knowledge about this. However, I did find out some very interesting things about how Nebula Knights could be improved in other ways. 
            The first and major way I have found that Nebula Knights could be improved would be through the addition of a Walkthrough Tutorial. This would be a level much like the 2 levels currently in the 
            game except much shorter, that slowly introduces new mechanics in each new room until the player has been introduced to all of the mechanics needed. This would fit in well with the architecture 
            of the levels anyway as they are already seperated by room. This means a tutorial set of rooms before a level would seamlessly fit in with the levels as they are.</h2>
