          <h2>The first interesting topic I found from my data is the fact that most people feel like a walkthrough tutorial is a very good tool for teaching a player the basics of a game.
            One reason why I feel like this is the case is that many people learn better by doing rather than seeing. If the player is put ina  controlled situatiojn where they can test out
            the movement and any other mechanics, then they could learn the mechanics far better by being able to actually use them. The average scoring of a walkthrough tutorial in my study
            was 7 out of 10. This shows that the majority of people really wanted a walkthrough tutorial to be added and thought that it would help them learn the game and help them enjoy the
            gaming experience.

          <h2> It could also be argued that in general, males prefer to have a more minimalistic design to their UI and generally find that more 
            minimal UI is easier to read and gain more info from. It can also be noted that males found it easier to navigate the main menu of Nebula Knights
            so it could be assumed that the main menu is of a more minimalistic design.</h2>
