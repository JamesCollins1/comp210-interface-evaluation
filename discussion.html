          <h2>The first interesting topic I found from my data is the fact that most people feel like a walkthrough tutorial is a very good tool for teaching a player the basics of a game.
            One reason why I feel like this is the case is that many people learn better by doing rather than seeing. If the player is put ina  controlled situatiojn where they can test out
            the movement and any other mechanics, then they could learn the mechanics far better by being able to actually use them. The average scoring of a walkthrough tutorial in my study
            was 7 out of 10 with a variance of 3. This shows that the majority of people really wanted a walkthrough tutorial to be added and thought that it would help them learn the game and help them enjoy the
            gaming experience. When we were developing Nebula Knights we were under quite intensive time constraints that meant that we could not prioritise a walkthrough tutorial while still 
            having a decent amount of gameplay.  An example of a good walkthrough tutorial is the tutorial level for Helldivers. It walks the player through each main mechanic in a training 
            facility setting. A video showing this of is:</h2>

            <h2>
                As you can see this type of tutorial really does help the player begin tobe immersed in the game and its storyline. However, they can take quite a while to develop as they need 
                to be bespoke for the game they are in as each game will have a different style, story line and mechanics. With a small development team and a tight deadline it can be hard to develop one.
                An interesting reason many people feel like a walkthrough tutorial should be an addition to other methods of conveying controls rather than a replacement for could be because of the different 
                ways that different people learn, however, this would need a lot of further research.

          <h2> Another interesting thing I found during this study was that the amount of control the players had over various settings in the game such as audio and graphical quality had very little effect on
            the level of enjoyment experrienced. This could have been down to the fact that the game was couch co-op which means that it capitalises on the competitive atmosphere created between players. 
            This means that less attention is played to the quality of the graphics or audio than in story based singleplayer games. However, this does not mean that these areas are completely forgotten about.
            I would have thought that many players would still find the lack of options or control quite annoying, but contrary to my belief this has proven not to be the case. The average rating players gave the 
            necessity for an options menu was 6.5 with a variance of 2.78. This means that although the average player would think that an options menu is a good addition, there is not a strong opinion on the matter.
            Some interviewees didn't find the lack of control a problem, while other found it "Quite annoying" and even thought that the game was missing something when they turned the audio off completely. This is a 
            relatively easy addition to make to a game and is something that, given a little more time, we would have liked to add to the game. I feel like if we were to add any more to the game, I would give this task 
            quite a high priority after the results of this study.    </h2>
